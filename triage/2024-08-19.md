# 2024-08-19 Triage Log

A fairly noisy week (though most of that has been dropped from this report).
Overall we saw several improvements, and ended the week on a net positive.
Memory usage is done around 1.5-3% over the course of the week, primarily due
to [RawVec polymorphization](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126793) and
[CloneToUninit impl expansion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126877).

#### Regressions

Fix problems with assoc expr token collection [#128725](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128725) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=4b7d074d766d00a32fa8b2e4fa3813dd7d4d64e6&end=be0ea0c99a00bc365d9f80f1c90f747967a2e152&stat=instructions:u)

Appears to be a real change in behavior (pre-merge showed fewer regressions)
but this is a correctness fix, so accepting them. 

#### Improvements

Rework MIR inlining debuginfo so function parameters show up in debuggers. [#128861](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128861) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=026e9ed3f0c5b3ee6233fd23b5e497cb94cf6434&end=3139ff09e9d07f7700f8d15ed25a231e29c43627&stat=instructions:u)

| All ❌✅ (primary)                 | -1.2% | [-1.4%, -1.1%] | 6     |

An improvement on many current benchmarks; the one regression is a spurious change.

#### Mixed

Apply "polymorphization at home" to RawVec [#126793](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126793) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=41dd149fd6a6a06795fc6b9f54cb49af2f61775f&end=13f8a57cfb57d527abe797230beabb64758bb888&stat=instructions:u)

| All ❌✅ (primary)                 | -0.1% | [-3.8%, 1.5%]  | 143   |

An improvement on many current benchmarks, though some regressions. Overall a
net positive. Also reduced memory usage by about 1% for many of our benchmarks,
which is a great win!

Regressions looks genuine, though relatively rare in our benchmark suite. It
might be worth doing some profiling of the Rust archive writer to see if
there's opportunities for optimization since it presumably hasn't received much
attention so far.

Regression on match-stress looks genuine but likely doesn't merit deeper
investigation given that this is in a rollup (and I don't see obvious
match-stress-implicating PRs in the list).
